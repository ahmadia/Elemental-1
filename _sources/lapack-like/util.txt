Householder reflectors
----------------------
**TODO:** Describe major difference from LAPACK's conventions (i.e., we do not 
treat the identity matrix as a Householder transform since it requires the 
:math:`u` in :math:`H=I-2uu'` to have norm zero rather than one). 

Applying packed Householder transforms
--------------------------------------
**TODO:** Describe ``ApplyPackedReflectors`` here.

Applying pivots
---------------
